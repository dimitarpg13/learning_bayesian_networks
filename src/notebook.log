Python 2.7 will no longer be supported in the next feature release of Poetry (1.2).
You should consider updating your Python version to a supported one.

Note that you will still be able to manage Python 2.7 projects by using the env command.
See https://python-poetry.org/docs/managing-environments/ for more information.
