# learning_bayesian_networks
This repo is a work in progress.

This is supplementary material to the book _"Learning Bayesian Networks"_ by R. Neapolitan.
We are going to look closely into the examples and exercises of chapters from the Book. There will be code for solving the examples and the excercies written in Python. For the purpose we will look into various open source libraries such as [`networkx`](https://pypi.org/project/networkx/), [`pomegranate`](https://pomegranate.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), [`bnlearn`](https://pypi.org/project/bnlearn/), [`bayespy`](https://www.bayespy.org/intro.html), and [`pgmpy`](https://pgmpy.org/) and we will choose the most suitable library for implementing the examples and excerices.
